- This is a gradle based idea project. It contains the gradle wrapper, hence, to build the project simply download IntelliJ Idea community edition and import the project.
- I've written the code using unit tests. The exercise has a main() method that receives the full input as a String, but I recommend to assess the validity of the exercise running the code as unit tests.
- Due to time constrains, I'm not checking the limits of the board / instructions mentioned in the description of the exercise.
